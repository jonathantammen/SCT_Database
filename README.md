Database System.

This is currently what was hastily hacked together late last year. The goal is to get a system that reads in times
in the specified format file, match those with an ordered list of finishers and keep track of results over multiple
events. 

I have very little knowledge of databases, so that's what I primarily need, and why the contents of this repository
are so apalling.

If you want to know what you can do to help, let me know and I'll assign some tasks to you.
